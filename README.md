Creating a private social media app for my family

**As a way to learn and review web development fundamentals I will be developing this site from scratch using vanilla HTML & CSS and JS
As I progress through I will start incorporating frameworks and work on developing a database to host user information, posts, messages, and photos

The goal is to create a fully functional  private Social Medis site for my family.
